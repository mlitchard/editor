Design doc

src-exe/Main.hs - grabs the first line, then passes the number that string
                  casts to. Editor is held in a StateT, but we
                  don't need the return value. This is easily changed.

src/Editor.hs - editor drives the process with a conduit pipeline.
                the conduit libraries allow efficient streaming,
                and easy interleaving. This was useful for the print command.

src/Actions.hs - This is where the functions that map to each 
                 editor command are kept, with their corresponding stateful
                 functions.

The price for conduits is wrapping one's head around the concepts involved,
and a huge set of choices. Some function names are obfuscating. 
For example, isolate. 

Alternatively, I could have stored print actions as a field in Editor.
This would have blown up memory usage, which I was trying to keep under control.

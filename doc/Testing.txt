Testing

Two types of testing are done here:

(1) integrated testing
(2) property testing

Integrated testing: 
  These use pre-created data sets to increase confidence that the system
  works as intended. They are meant to test the system as a whole.

Property tests:
  These test two of the editor functions, append and delete, specifically.
  I use QuickCheck to pass through random data to insure
  that append appends, and delete deletes.
